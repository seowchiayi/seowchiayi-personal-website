summary: 'Going through a confusing phase of my career as a software engineer'
---

As a software engineer I realise I am not reflecting on my work frequently enough with myself, the experienced engineers I have surrounded myself with.

I want to start writing about my work/my side projects more so I can reflect on how I learn, so I learn faster next time and let the public give feedback on what can I do better/what am I doing correctly.

Starting from the first side project I worked on - [DevLog](https://github.com/seowchiayi/multion-hackathon).

I want to talk about
- the motivation of the project
- what has the project achieved
- if I want to continue working on it


## Motivation of the project
To pick up tools used in the AI agents/LLM space.

## What has the project achieved
- I presented the idea infront of 10 people in a foreign city (ps: its my second time in SF and I haven't presented anything infront of anyone since university).
- I executed the first iteration on an idea of mine to build something that would help developers like myself.

## Do I want to continue working on it?
Yes. I want to spend more time thinking about the ideal scenarios of the develoepers after using my tool.
